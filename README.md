# Concept-Localization-Experiments
Experiments on concept localization on XTRAINS and SCDB datasets. Custom network, ResNet-18 and MobileNet-V2.

The repository contains the results of experiments on the localization of ontology concepts in deep convolutional neural networks of three different architectures (Custom, MobileNet-V2, and ResNet-18).

Experiments were conducted on two datasets:

- [Explainable Abstract Trains Dataset (XTRAINS)](https://bitbucket.org/xtrains/dataset/) <br />
